# My First JavaScript Space

Mini Projects included in this project (in the order I did them) so far...

**[dcode on YouTube - Build a To-Do list in 20 minutes with JavaScript](https://youtu.be/cijPd-TXPn4?si=VEEkAH6fVqfTy0uV)** I loved this is a first mini project, great tutorial, though it did take me slightly longer than 20 minutes! I have some plans to upgrade this, by adding a priority and serch function, and a count or log of completed tasks.

When I find the first todo image I'll replace this text; The first list established that this app saves the todo items to your local browser so is avaiable between sessions. 

**[Coding by CodingLab](www.codinglabweb.com)** The Number Game Mark showed us.  

**[W3schools - Create a js dropdown menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp)**

I added some other min projects; a cool number game Mark Briscow showed us in class, and a dropdown button as I needed to learn that for another project. And realised I could use the JS dropdown menu as a way to organise these mini projects into something meaningful.
