# My First JavaScript Space

Mini Projects included in this project (in the order I did them) so far...

**[dcode on YouTube - Build a To-Do list in 20 minutes with JavaScript](https://youtu.be/cijPd-TXPn4?si=VEEkAH6fVqfTy0uV)** I loved this is a first mini project, great tutorial, though it did take me slightly longer than 20 minutes! I have some plans to upgrade this, by adding a priority and serch function, and a count or log of completed tasks.

When I find the first todo image I'll replace this text; The first list established that this app saves the todo items to your local browser so is avaiable between sessions. 

**[Coding by CodingLab](www.codinglabweb.com)** The Number Game Mark showed us.  

**[W3schools - Create a js dropdown menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp)**

## Problems Encountered
I created a repo (called something about a quiz") intending to follow a tutorial. Then I found another tutorial (the todo list) which I thought would be more practical. I attempted to rename the repo, but continued to work in the original Gitpod workspace. Yeah... Don't do that! 

I added some other min projects; a cool number game Mark Briscow showed us in class, and a dropdown button as I needed to learn that for another project. And realised I could use the JS dropdown menu as a way to organise these mini projects into something meaningful. 

However, when I tried to push all my changes to Github, Gitpod said no. 

I know I've messed it up, and just felt at this stage I'd be better to start with a new repo and just copy the code over. Not ideal, and I *should* learn to bracktrack in Gitpod, but the pressure is on and I still can't see my keyboard (Glasses hopefully arrive before Weds next week in time to start my first Personal Project!)

So here we are!
